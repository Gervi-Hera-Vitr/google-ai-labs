The traditional scene approach to learning and teaching anything is one) aggressively hands-on,
two) teachings and learning at the same time, and three) no grouping but pairing instead.
Point _two_ means that there are no teachers in the traditional sense,
no lectures, no telling and showing while others observe.
A mentor always joins one champion at a time to learn and discover together.
Thus, Socratic mentorship mindset is instilled from the very beginning,
every champion is a student and a teacher at the same time.
But most importantly, the destination between the teacher and the student
SHOULD NEVER BE MADE - it's a taboo.
_On the Scene *everyone* is a peer to everyone else._
We learn together!

== ML 101: Machine Learning Basics

Before we dive into the world of Machine Learning, we need to learn the fundamentals.

=== ML 101.1: Machine Learning Crash Course: Linear Regression

The idea is to wet the appetite for learning with a Linera Regression example.

=== ML 101.2: Machine Learning Crash Course: Data Structures

Now it's time to break down the concepts we'd just used in the Linear Regression sheet.
