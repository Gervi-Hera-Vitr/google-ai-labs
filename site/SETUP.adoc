Important tribal knowledge::

Traditionally, *_"GitHub Pages"_* support is a strongly locked-down affair.
This created many conflicts with Jekyll, various Gems, and GitHub Pages plugins.
The GitHub Pages Actions workflow is meant to partially alleviate the issue.

== Mac OS X Setup

[source,shell]
.Use `asdf` to install Ruby
----
#!/usr/bin/env zsh

brew update && brew upgrade --greedy && brew install coreutils curl asdf

----

=== Install latest `ruby` using `asdf`

[TIP]
.The `asdf` delegates to resource managers called plugins.
====
`asdf` manage tool artifacts via dedicated plugins.
Here is the https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html['Getting Started' guide] for `asdf`;
documentation on https://asdf-vm.com/manage/core.html[core] functionality;
and, TL;DR on https://asdf-vm.com/manage/plugins.html[plugins] and https://asdf-vm.com/manage/versions.html[version] management.

[source,shell]
.to #list# all plugins, for example, use:
----
asdf plugin list all
----

and,

[source,shell]
.to #upgrade# all plugins, use:
----
asdf plugin update --all
----

====

[source,shell]
.Install `ruby` plugin (see https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby[the `ruby` home repository] to get the sense of plugins):
----

# Formally: `asdf plugin add ruby https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby.git`
# the override reference to plugin repository is NOT necessary when using default plugins.
asdf plugin add ruby

----

then, install the latest `ruby`:

[source,shell]
.Install the latest `ruby` by version symlink:
----

asdf install ruby latest

----

=== Verify: useful commands:

[source,shell]
.Checking versions:
----

# See all installed ruby versions:
asdf list ruby

# See currently active versions:
asdf current

# See ALL installable versions:
# asdf list all ruby

----

== Install Jekyll and GitHub Pages dependencies

#Navigate into your project docs directory before working on Jekyll site!#

Follow the https://jekyllrb.com/docs/[Jekyll Quickstart] documentation.

[source,shell]
.Install `jekyll` +  `bundler`:
----

gem install jekyll bundler

----

[IMPORTANT]
.If newer versions exist:
====
Should the global tool be installed before, one may get a message like this:

 A new release of RubyGems is available: 3.5.16 ‚Üí 3.5.22!
 Run `gem update --system 3.5.22` to update your installation.

Then run the suggested upgrade: `gem update --system 3.5.22`

====

From the root of our project run `jekyll new site` with the 'site' being the home folder of the site.
Since we already have the folder, the following command was necessary instead:

[source,shell]
.Make site scaffolding:
----

jekyll new site --force

----

... and we have a blank site now.

== Ponder on the site scaffold:

__The scaffolding has an autoloader feature helping with the fast-paced fluent development style use.__

[source,shell]
.Check the site scaffold:
----

 bundle exec jekyll serve

----

== That's it!

We have then modified our site to apply https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes[Minimal Mistakes] Jekyll theme.
