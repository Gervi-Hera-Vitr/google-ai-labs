1.Early Ukrainian's
The Stone Age and Early Ukraine Settlement:
The first Humanoid creatures appeared in East Africa 2.5 million years ago.
A group, The first Ukrainian's migrated to Europe via the Balkans around 1.2 million years ago.
Ukraine has the oldest discovered settlements of hominids in Central and Eastern Europe (e.g., Coro and Medzh sites).

Ukrainian's Homo Sapiens Arrival:
Modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) emerged in East Africa ~200,000 years ago, reached Europe ~40,000 years ago.
Neanderthals, also present in Europe, were eventually replaced by Homo sapiens.

2.Early Ukrainian's Advancements:
Cultural and Technological Advancements of Ukrainian's:
Early art: Ornaments, figurines, and tools were discovered in Ukrainian sites (e.g., mammoth ivory bracelets, painted tusks).
Religious beliefs appeared, as seen in burial practices.
Advanced tools like needles, musical instruments, and mammoth-bone dwellings were developed.

3. Regional Impacts on Ukrainian's
The Impact of the Ice Age Glaciation and Climate:
The Ice Age (~1 million years ago) created glaciers up to several kilometers thick, shaping Europe’s geography.
Winds from glaciers helped form Ukraine's fertile soil.

Extinction of Megafauna:
Mammoths and woolly rhinoceroses became extinct due to climate changes and scarcity of food.
Reindeer, buffalo, and horses thrived, becoming primary prey for humans.

4. More Ukrainian's Advances:
Transition to Agriculture (Neolithic Revolution) From Hunting to Farming:
Around 7th–4th millennium BC, people in Ukraine adopted agriculture and cattle breeding.
Tools like flint-bladed sickles and slash-and-burn farming methods were introduced.

Cultural Changes:
Pottery invention improved food storage.
More sedentary lifestyles allowed population growth and village formation.
The Black Sea Flood and Environmental Changes

5. More Environmental impacts on Ukrainian's
Formation of the Black Sea:
Around 5,600 BC, the Mediterranean Sea spilled into the Black Sea, turning it from a freshwater lake into a salty sea.
Flooding reshaped the region and forced human migrations.
Stone Age Timeline in Ukraine

6. Massive Ukrainian Advances:
Stone Age End:
The Stone Age ended in Ukraine between the 5th and 3rd millennium BC, with the introduction of metal tools (copper and bronze).
Central Russia’s Stone Age lasted 3,000–5,000 years longer, explaining cultural differences between regions.
Social Structures and Ideologies

Primitive Societies:
Communities were highly collective, and individuals depended on cooperation to survive.
Moral relativism (belief in subjective truths) was a survival mechanism but shifted as societies became more complex.

Leadership Evolution:
Transition to larger, organized communities led to the rise of chiefs and hierarchical systems, with traits like strength and cunning becoming key leadership qualities.
Autocratic tendencies in some cultures (e.g., Russia) have roots in these early societal structures.

7. Ukrainian Culture Advances:
The Trypillian (Tripillia) Culture:
Discovery: Ukrainian archaeologist Vicenti Khvoika discovered ancient pottery near Trypillia, dating back to the 6th millennium BC.
Development:
 The Trypillian culture was advanced, comparable to early civilizations in the Balkans and Mediterranean.
Settlements:
Built unfortified villages and cultivated plains, not just river valleys.
Large settlements in Cherkasy had up to 20,000 residents and 3,000 houses, larger than medieval towns.
Houses often had two floors, showcasing architectural progress.
Significance: Their prosperity was due to the fertility of Ukrainian lands.

8. More Ukrainian Cultures
Location: Originated in the lower Dnipro and Don regions, bordering Trypillian culture.
Lifestyle: Transitioned from farming to transhumance (seasonal herding of livestock).
Interaction: Archaeological evidence shows intermarriage between Trypillians and Seredny Stih people.
Contributions:
Played a foundational role in the ancestry of the Indo-Europeans.

9. Ukrainian's expansion/Indo-European
Origins: The Seredny Stih culture contributed to the rise of the Indo-European people, whose languages are now spoken by over half the global population.
Migration:
Indo-Europeans migrated from Ukraine between the 4th and 2nd millennia BC, spreading across Europe, Asia, and even as far as India.
They used domesticated horses and wagons, giving them a military and economic edge.
Cultural Practices:
Worshipped the sun, fire, and weapons.
Burial practices included red ochre and stone axes, symbolizing rebirth and power.
Related Peoples: Closely connected to Slavs, Balts (Lithuanians, Latvians), Indo-Iranians, and Germanic peoples (e.g., Germans, Scandinavians, Dutch).

10. Ukrainian's Domestication of the Horse
First Evidence: Horses were domesticated in Ukraine in the 4th millennium BC (e.g., evidence in Dereivka village).
Importance: Horses were initially difficult to domesticate but became critical for transportation and warfare.
Impact:
Cavalry and wagons gave Indo-European tribes dominance over other groups.
Horses were feared and respected in ancient civilizations like Egypt.

11. Indo-Iranians in Ukraine
Presence: Indo-Iranian tribes remained in the steppes of southern Ukraine.
Cultural Legacy: These tribes were ancestors of groups in India and Iran.
Historical Mention: Indo-Iranians (Scythians) were the first Eastern Europeans recorded in literature, such as Homer’s Iliad.
Achievements:
Built stone cities, wielded long swords, and conducted raids in central Ukraine.

Significance of Ukrainian Lands
Fertile soil and strategic location allowed for the rise of advanced cultures.
Ukraine served as a cradle for Indo-European migration, language, and innovations like horse domestication.
